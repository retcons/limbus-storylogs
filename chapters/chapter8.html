              Yes, a rudimentary application of the Bolus production
              methodology. However, one thing we must know is that the law
              followed by our ingredients is not defined solely by the five
              phases and eight trigrams. Though the five phases are correctly
              aligned, ingredients each imbued with elements of the sexagenary
              cycle—distinguished by both the heavenly stems and the earthly
              branches—all exhibit different effects.

              Another aspect of this art to consider is that spacetime itself is

              thus, even if the same recipe were to be followed to the letter,
              the hour, the minute, and the second during which the Bolus is
              combined affects its quality and characteristics.
