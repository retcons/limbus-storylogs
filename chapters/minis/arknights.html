              It is incorrect to state that the manager cannot ‘talk human’. A
              more accurate assessment would state that the manager is incapable
              of accessing sonic means of communication, which includes verbal
              communication; however, they are able to produce repetition of
              multiple sounds that may register on a similar scale to the
              ticking of multiple hands—second hands, minute hands—of a clock.
