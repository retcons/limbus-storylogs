              Buildings utilizing P Corp.&#x27;s Singularity have a very high

              blood, splashing inside their pupils were my evidence. But when I

              often vary depending on the higher Bloodfiend&#x27;s abilities.
              However, it is usually impossible for lower Bloodfiends to revolt
              against someone higher up the bloodstream. While there is no
              physical barrier stopping them, there is an intense psychological
              barrier preventing them from doing so.
